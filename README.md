## Installation

Download this repo as a zip, drop it into your desired project folder. For example’s sake we’ll say we’re creating `hello_app`.

Once you’ve unzipped Middleplate into your folder, `cd` to that folder in Terminal, and run `bundle install` (you may need to `sudo` it):

```
cd example/path/to/folder/hello_app
bundle install
```

If all is well you’ll get a `Your bundle is complete!` message and you’re good to go.

From there you just need set it on its way:

```
bundle exec middleman
```

This will load Middleman and allow you to access your site at `http://0.0.0.0:4567` or `localhost:4567` (unless you’ve set a different default port).

## Troubleshooting

For any issues, first check the [Middleman docuimentation](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/ "Read the Middleman docs"), as it’s likely that there will be an answer in there (especially for installation).

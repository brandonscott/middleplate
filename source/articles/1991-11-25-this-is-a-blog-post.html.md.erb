description: A bit on my trip to Bristol for Web Dev Conf 2013 â€“ my new favourite conference!
tldr: WDC 2013 was a brilliantly arranged array of talks, in a lovely city; it was a great opportunity to catch up with Jake, meet a few of the speakers, and others I'd met through Twitter. My single criticism would be the lack of popcorn given its cinema location, but that is just the inner-child trying to claw its way out. Cheers to the organisers, and I plan on making this one a regular date in my calendar.
